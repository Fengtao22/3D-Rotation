# 3D-Rotation
This repo explains the limits of Euler rotation and covers the topic of quaternion. In particular, this repo discusses the basic of Euler rotation and its limitation (Gimbal Lock). Then talks about the alternative approach for 3D rotation (quaternion). Finally, we also covers the Unity rotation transformation (left hand rule).
